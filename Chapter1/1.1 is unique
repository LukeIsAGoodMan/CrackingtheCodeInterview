        It is used to calculate a number that represents the bit value of having that 
        character index as a 1 and the rest as a 0, this is achieved
        by getting the single digit 1 and shifting it to the left as many
        times as the character index requires
        e.g. character 'd'
        00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001
        Shift 3 spaces to the left (<<) because 'd' index is number 3
        1 shift: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000010
        2 shift: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000100
        3 shift: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00001000

        Therefore the number representing 'd' is
        00000000 00000000 00000000 00001000

         */
        int singleBitOnPosition = 1 << characterIndex;

        /*
        This peforms an AND between the checker, which is the bit array
        containing everything that has been found before and the number
        representing the bit that will be turned on for this particular
        character. e.g.
        if we have already seen 'a', 'b' and 'd', checker will have:
        checker = 00000000 00000000 00000000 00001011
        And if we see 'b' again:
        'b' = 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000010

        it will do the following:
        00000000 00000000 00000000 00001011
        & (AND)
        00000000 00000000 00000000 00000010
        -----------------------------------
        00000000 00000000 00000000 00000010

        Since this number is different than '0' it means that the character
        was seen before, because on that character index we already have a 
        1 bit value
         */
        if ((checker & singleBitOnPosition) > 0) {
            return false;
        }

        /* 
        Remember that 
        checker |= singleBitOnPosition is the same as  
        checker = checker | singleBitOnPosition
        Sometimes it is easier to see it expanded like that.

        What this achieves is that it builds the checker to have the new 
        value it hasnt seen, by doing an OR between checker and the value 
        representing this character index as a 1. e.g.
        If the character is 'f' and the checker has seen 'g' and 'a', the 
        following will happen

        'f' = 00000000 00000000 00000000 00100000
        checker(seen 'a' and 'g' so far) = 00000000 00000000 00000000 01000001

        00000000 00000000 00000000 00100000
        | (OR)
        00000000 00000000 00000000 01000001
        -----------------------------------
        00000000 00000000 00000000 01100001

        Therefore getting a new checker as 00000000 00000000 00000000 01100001
