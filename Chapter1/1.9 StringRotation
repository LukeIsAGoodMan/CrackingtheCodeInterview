//
If we imagine that 52 is a rotation of 51, then we can ask what the rotation point is. For example, if you
rotate waterbottle after wat. you get erbottlewat. In a rotation, we cut 51 into two parts, x and y,
and rearrange them to get 52.
S1 = xy = waterbottle
x = wat 
y = erbottle
S2 = yx = erbottlewat 
So, we need to check if there's a way to split s1 into x and y such that xy = s1 and yx = s2. Regardless of
where the division between x and y is, we can see thatyx will always be a substring of xyxy.That is, s2 will
always be a substring of s1s1.
And this is precisely how we solve the problem: simply do isSubstring(slsl, s2)
